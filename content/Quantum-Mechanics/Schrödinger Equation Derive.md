## Time Dependent Schrödinger Equation Drive
The time-independent Schrödinger equation is derived by assuming the potential energy $V(x)$ does not depend on time and applying the method of separation of variables to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. Here is a step-by-step derivation:

1. Start from the Time-dependent Schrödinger Equation
The fundamental equation of quantum mechanics for a particle of mass $m$ in a potential $V(x)$ is

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi(x, t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi(x, t)}{\partial x^2} + V(x)\Psi(x, t)
$$

***
2. Separation of Variables
Assume solutions can be written as a product of a spatial function and a time function:

$$
\Psi(x, t) = \psi(x) T(t)
$$
Plug into the time-dependent equation:
$$
i\hbar \psi(x) \frac{dT(t)}{dt} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} T(t) \frac{d^2\psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x)\psi(x)T(t)
$$
***
3. Divide by $\psi(x)T(t)$ and Rearrange

$$
i\hbar \frac{1}{T(t)} \frac{dT(t)}{dt} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{1}{\psi(x)} \frac{d^2\psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x)
$$

Notice the left side only depends on time; the right side only on position. Therefore, both must be equal to a constant, labeled $E$:
$$
i\hbar \frac{1}{T(t)} \frac{dT(t)}{dt} = E
$$

$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{1}{\psi(x)} \frac{d^2\psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x) = E
$$

***
4. Solve the Spatial Equation (Time-independent Schrödinger Equation)

$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2\psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x)\psi(x) = E\psi(x)
$$
Or, rearranged:

$$
\hat{H}\psi(x) = E\psi(x)
$$

where
$$
\hat{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x)
$$

This is the time-independent Schrödinger equation. The function $\psi(x)$ is called a stationary state or an eigenfunction, and $E$ the corresponding energy eigenvalue.

5. Physical Significance and Generalization

- Solutions $\psi(x)$ describe possible spatial states of the particle with (usually quantized) energies $E$.
- For three-dimensional problems, replace \$ x \$ by \$ \vec{r} \$ and the second derivative by the Laplacian:
$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi(\vec{r}) + V(\vec{r})\psi(\vec{r}) = E\psi(\vec{r})
$$
***
**In summary:**
The time-independent Schrödinger equation is obtained by assuming time-independent potential and using separation of variables, leading to the spatial eigenvalue equation for possible stationary states:
$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2\psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x)\psi(x) = E\psi(x)
$$

## Time Depenedent Schrodinger Equation Drive

The time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) is the foundational equation describing the quantum evolution of a system's wavefunction over time. Its form and plausibility are motivated by analogies with classical energy relations, de Broglie's wave-particle duality, and the necessity for a first-order differential equation in time. Here is a step-by-step "derivation" and motivation, as accepted widely in quantum mechanics:
#### Physical Motivation and Postulates
- In classical mechanics, the total energy of a particle is given by:

$$
E = \frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x)
$$
where $p$ is the momentum and $V(x)$ the potential energy.
- Quantum mechanics postulates that each observable is represented by an operator. Position $x$ acts as multiplication by $x$, while the momentum operator is:
$$
\hat{p} = -i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x}
$$
Energy as an operator similarly becomes:
$$
\hat{E} = i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}
$$
- The quantum state is described by a wavefunction $\Psi(x, t)$ that evolves over time.
#### Postulated Form and Mathematical Expression
Combining these, one posits the operator equation:
$$
\hat{E}\Psi(x,t) = \left(\frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m} + V(x)\right)\Psi(x,t)
$$
Translating to differential form:
$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(x, t) = \left( -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V(x) \right)\Psi(x, t)
$$
This is the **time-dependent Schrödinger equation** in one dimension.

==> **Motivation Using Plane Waves**

Schrödinger’s reasoning:
- For a free particle ($V(x) = 0$), de Broglie’s relation gives $p = \hbar k$ and Planck’s formula gives $E = \hbar \omega$.[^2]
- Consider a plane wave:
$$
\Psi(x,t) = Ae^{i(kx - \omega t)}
$$

Acting with $-i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ gives momentum $\hbar k$ for the wave, and $i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ gives energy $\hbar \omega$.
- Substituting into the operator equation reproduces the known relations for energy and momentum.
- This linear equation applies not only to plane waves but to any superposition, capturing the core of quantum wave dynamics.

===>  **Generalization to 3D and Hamiltonian Form**

For three dimensions and more general systems, the equation can be written as
$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi(\vec{r}, t)}{\partial t} = \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V(\vec{r}) \right] \Psi(\vec{r}, t)
$$
Or, more compactly,
$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi = \hat{H}\Psi
$$
where the **Hamiltonian operator** $\hat{H}$ encodes all the kinetic and potential energy terms.

==> **Summary: Essence of the "Derivation"**

- The TDSE is not rigorously derived from first principles; it is postulated to generalize energy conservation and wave dynamics for quantum systems inspired by de Broglie relations, operator substitution rules, and Planck’s quantization.
- Its form is uniquely fixed by requiring first-order time evolution, linearity, and consistency with classical energy in the appropriate limit.

**Core equation (1D):**
$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x, t) = \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V(x) \right] \Psi(x, t)
$$
**Core equation (3D):**
$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\vec{r}, t) = \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V(\vec{r}) \right] \Psi(\vec{r}, t)
$$

This equation fully determines the time evolution of quantum systems and underlines the entire structure of non-relativistic quantum mechanics.
