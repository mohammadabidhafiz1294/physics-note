A Geiger-Müller (GM) tube is a gas-filled radiation detector used to detect ionizing radiation. Let's break down your queries:
### **Efficiency of a GM Tube**

The **efficiency** of a GM tube refers to its ability to detect radiation events compared to the total number of such events occurring in its vicinity. It is generally expressed as:
$$\text{Efficiency} (\%) = \left( \frac{\text{Counts detected by the GM tube}}{\text{Actual radiation events}} \right) \times 100$$

#### **Does Efficiency Vary?**

Yes, the efficiency of a GM tube varies depending on several factors:

1. **Type of Radiation:**
    
    - **Alpha particles**: Efficiency is typically low because alpha particles are easily stopped by the GM tube's window or outer layer.
    - **Beta particles**: Efficiency is higher for beta particles, but it depends on the energy of the particles and the tube's window thickness.
    - **Gamma rays**: Efficiency is generally very low since gamma rays have high penetrating power and are less likely to interact with the gas inside the tube.
2. **Energy of Radiation:**
    
    - High-energy particles or photons are more likely to penetrate the detector without interaction, reducing efficiency.
    - Low-energy particles may be absorbed or deflected before reaching the sensitive volume of the tube.
3. **Window Thickness:**
    
    - Thinner windows improve efficiency for low-energy beta and alpha particles but may compromise durability.
4. **Gas Type and Pressure:**
    
    - The type and pressure of the gas inside the tube influence the likelihood of ionization events when radiation interacts with the gas.
5. **Geometry and Detector Size:**
    
    - Larger tubes or tubes with optimized geometry can improve efficiency by increasing the interaction cross-section.

### **Relative Efficiency**

**Relative efficiency** is a comparative measure of the GM tube's ability to detect radiation relative to a standard detector (often a scintillation detector or NaI(Tl) crystal). It is typically given as a ratio or percentage and provides a practical way to compare detectors for specific radiation types or energies.

### **Beta Decay and Decay Schema in a GM Tube**

If beta decay occurs near or within the GM tube, it involves the emission of a **beta particle** (electron or positron) from an unstable nucleus. The general schema of beta decay is:

1. **Beta-minus decay (β−\beta^-):**
    $$n \rightarrow p^+ + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$$
    - A neutron decays into a proton, emitting an electron (e−e^-) and an antineutrino (νˉe\bar{\nu}_e).
2. **Beta-plus decay (β+\beta^+):**
    $$p^+ \rightarrow n + e^+ + \nu_e$$
    - A proton decays into a neutron, emitting a positron (e+e^+) and a neutrino (νe\nu_e).

In a GM tube:
- The beta particle (e−e^- or e+e^+) may ionize the gas atoms, leading to a detectable electrical pulse.
- The neutrinos escape without interaction, as they rarely interact with matter.

#### **Cesium-137 (${137}\text{Cs}$) Decay Schema**

Cesium-137 is a beta-emitting radionuclide with the following decay modes:

1. **Beta-minus decay $(\beta^-)$ to Barium-137m (${137m}\text{Ba}$):**
    $$^{137}\text{Cs} \xrightarrow{\beta^-} ^{137m}\text{Ba} + \nu_e$$
    - Cesium-137 undergoes beta decay to a metastable state of barium-137 (137mBa^{137m}\text{Ba}).
    - The beta particles emitted have a maximum energy of 0.512 MeV.
    - 137mBa^{137m}\text{Ba} is in an excited state.
2. **Gamma emission from Barium-137m:**
    
    137mBa→γ137Ba^{137m}\text{Ba} \xrightarrow{\gamma} ^{137}\text{Ba}
    - The metastable barium-137 emits a 662 keV gamma photon to reach the ground state (137Ba^{137}\text{Ba}).

**Key Points:**

- This process happens in two steps but appears simultaneous because the half-life of 137mBa^{137m}\text{Ba} is only about 2.55 minutes.
- Nearly 94.6% of 137Cs^{137}\text{Cs} decays produce 137mBa^{137m}\text{Ba}, leading to gamma emission.

3. **Rare direct decay to stable 137Ba^{137}\text{Ba}:**
    - In ~5.4% of decays, 137Cs^{137}\text{Cs} directly decays to the stable ground state of 137Ba^{137}\text{Ba} without passing through the metastable state.

**Simultaneity of Processes:**

- The two beta-decay processes (to 137mBa^{137m}\text{Ba} and 137Ba^{137}\text{Ba}) occur simultaneously, but the pathway through 137mBa^{137m}\text{Ba} is dominant.

### **Cobalt-60 (60Co^{60}\text{Co}) Decay Schema**

Cobalt-60 is a beta emitter that undergoes the following decay process:

1. **Beta-minus decay (β−\beta^-) to Nickel-60 (60Ni^{60}\text{Ni}):**
    
    60Co→β−60Ni+νe^{60}\text{Co} \xrightarrow{\beta^-} ^{60}\text{Ni} + \nu_e
    - Beta decay produces a beta particle (e−e^-) and an antineutrino (νe\nu_e).
    - The beta particles have a maximum energy of 0.318 MeV.
2. **Gamma emission from Nickel-60:**
    
    - The 60Ni^{60}\text{Ni} nucleus is left in an excited state and emits **two gamma photons** in a cascade:
        - 1.17 MeV
        - 1.33 MeV

**Key Points:**

- The decay scheme always results in gamma emission after beta decay.
- Gamma photons are often detected in radiation measurement setups.

### **Summary of Key Points**

- **Cesium-137:**
    
    - Two beta-decay processes: dominant decay to 137mBa^{137m}\text{Ba} (94.6%) and direct decay to 137Ba^{137}\text{Ba} (5.4%).
    - The two processes occur simultaneously but with different probabilities.
- **Cobalt-60:**
    
    - Beta decay is always followed by the emission of two gamma photons (1.17 MeV and 1.33 MeV).
