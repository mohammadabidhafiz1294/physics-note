### Observables & Operator
In classical mechanics, an observable is a real-valued "function" on the set of all possible system states, e.g., position and momentum. In quantum mechanics, **an observable is an operator, or gauge, where the property of the quantum state can be determined by some sequence of operations**.

### Hermitian vs hamiltonian in QM
In quantum mechanics, a Hermitian operator is a mathematical object that represents observable physical quantities, whereas the Hamiltonian is a special type of Hermitian operator that describes the total energy and governs the time evolution of the quantum system.

##### Hermitian Operators
- Hermitian operators have the defining property $A^\dagger = A$, meaning the operator equals its own adjoint (complex conjugate transpose).
- All eigenvalues of Hermitian operators are real, which matches the requirement that measured physical quantities must be real numbers.
- The eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal, and the set of eigenfunctions forms a complete basis for the function space.
- Examples include operators for position, momentum, and other physical observables.

#### Hamiltonian Operator
- The Hamiltonian, denoted by $H$, is a Hermitian operator that represents the total energy of the system.
- The Hamiltonian uniquely determines the time evolution of the quantum state via the Schrödinger equation: $$i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi\rangle = H|\psi\rangle$$.
- The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian correspond to the allowed energy levels of the system, and its eigenvectors (stationary states) give the possible quantum energy states.
- The Hamiltonian is often constructed from the sum of kinetic and potential energy terms, e.g., $H = \frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m} + V(\hat{x})$.

| Completeness   | Forms complete basis of state space             | Forms complete basis of energy states       |
| Special Cases  | Position, momentum, angular momentum, etc.      | Always total system energy                  |
| QM Postulate   | All observables must be Hermitian               | Hamiltonian is always Hermitian             |

==**Key Points**==
- All Hamiltonians must be Hermitian, but not all Hermitian operators are Hamiltonians.
- Hermitian operators are crucial for representing observables so that measurements yield real outcomes.
- The Hamiltonian has a special status because it determines both energy and the time evolution of quantum systems.

In summary, Hermitian operators generalize the concept of measurable quantities, while the Hamiltonian is the unique Hermitian operator responsible for the energy and dynamics of quantum systems.
