### Why the transformation theory is important that tha operators are unitary?
The transformation theory in quantum mechanics requires operators to be unitary because this ensures that key physical properties are preserved during transformations: probabilities, normalization, and physical observables are all conserved under unitary transformations. Specifically, unitary operators satisfy $UU^\dagger = U^\dagger U = I$, which means they preserve the inner product (scalar product) between state vectors, and thus the total probability remains unchanged after the transformation.

##### Conservation of Probability and Observables
Unitary operators guarantee that the transformed states remain normalized and observable quantities (represented by Hermitian operators) retain their physical meaning after transformation. If an operator were not unitary, transformation could alter the probabilities or even the expectation values of observables, violating fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics.

##### Symmetry and Conservation Laws
Transformation theory is built on the relationship between symmetries (such as translation, rotation, parity) and conservation laws (such as momentum, energy, angular momentum). These symmetries are mathematically represented by unitary operators. When the Hamiltonian (the energy operator) is invariant under a unitary transformation, it means a corresponding observable is conserved (e.g., invariance under translations implies momentum conservation).

##### Active and Passive Transformations
Both active and passive transformations are described by unitary operators. The unitarity ensures that the change of basis or the change in description of vectors and operators does not alter the physical predictionsâ€”the two perspectives lead to the same physics since unitary transformations guarantee the invariance of essential quantities such as traces, determinants, and commutators relevant to observable properties.

##### Mathematical Structure
Mathematically, unitary operators generalize rotation operators in complex vector spaces. They preserve the lengths (norms) and angles (inner products) between vectors, making them essential for representing quantum mechanical transformations, such as time evolution or changes of basis. The eigenvalues of unitary operators have modulus one, meaning their action can only change the phase, not the magnitude, of a quantum state, preserving physical probabilities.

In sum, the requirement that transformation operators be unitary stems from the need to preserve probabilities, normalization, conservation laws, and physical observables under quantum mechanical transformations, reflecting deep symmetry principles and the mathematical structure of quantum theory.
