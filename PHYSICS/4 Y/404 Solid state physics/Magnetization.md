### **spectroscopic Splitting factor or **Landé g-factor**** 
The **spectroscopic splitting factor**, also known as the **Landé g-factor** (gJg_JgJ), is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the ratio of the magnetic moment to the angular momentum for an atom, ion, or electron state. It determines the size of the energy splitting (Zeeman effect) when the system is placed in a magnetic field.

**==>** **Definition**
The Landé g-factor is given by:
$$gJ= 1 + \frac{J(J+1) + S(S+1) - L(L+1)}{2J(J+1)}gJ=$$
where:
- J is the total angular momentum quantum number,
- L is the orbital angular momentum quantum number,
- S is the total spin quantum number.
This formula combines the contributions from both orbital and spin angular momenta to the total magnetic moment.
**==>  **Physical Meaning****
- The factor *$g_J$* appears in the expression for the energy splitting of atomic levels in an applied magnetic field:$$\Delta E = g_J \mu_B B m_J$$
    where $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, B is the magnetic field, and $m_J$ is the magnetic quantum number for J.
- For a pure spin system (like a free electron), $g \approx 2$.
- For states with both orbital and spin contributions, gJg_JgJ can take intermediate values depending on S,L, and J.
#### Why It Matters
- The Landé g-factor shows how effective the total angular momentum is at producing a magnetic moment, affecting observable phenomena like electron spin resonance (ESR) and atomic spectra splitting in magnetic fields.
- It provides the numerical factor connecting magnetic moment measurements with quantum numbers.
